 After our rocket was launchedü§ó, let's catch our first ‚ù§Ô∏èPok√©mon!
 
 Though there have three Pok√© Balls, but **ONLY the fastest one** can catch a Pok√©mon.
 
 And you can also randomly meet other Pok√©mon.

 Which Pok√©mon will choose you?
 
 Think about it and experiment now!

 Why have you always gotten the second one? Why even a straight line is the slowest?

 This is a famous problem called [Brachistochrone Problem](glossary://Brachistochrone%20Problem) posed by [Johann Bernoulli](glossary://Johann%20Bernoulli) in June 1696.

 [Galileo](glossary://Galileo) in 1638 had studied the problem in his famous work(Discourse on two new sciences). He think that the path of quickest descent from A to B would be an arc of a circle.

 At the end, five mathematicians responded with solutions via [calculus of variations](glossary://calculus%20of%20variations) or [Snell's law](glossary://Snell's%20law): [Newton](glossary://Newton), Jakob Bernoulli (Johann's brother), [Gottfried Leibniz](glossary://Gottfried%20Leibniz), [Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus](glossary://Ehrenfried%20Walther%20von%20Tschirnhaus) and [Guillaume de l'H√¥pital](glossary://Guillaume%20de%20l'Hopital).
