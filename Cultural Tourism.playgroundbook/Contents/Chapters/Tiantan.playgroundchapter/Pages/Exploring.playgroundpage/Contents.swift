 Welcome, travelers!

 Have you ever heard about the Temple of Heaven in Beijing? 

 The Temple of Heaven is an imperial complex of religious buildings situated in the southeastern part of central Beijing, China. The complex was visited by the Emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties for annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven for good harvest. It has been regarded as a Taoist temple, although Chinese heaven worship, especially by the reigning monarch of the day, predates Taoism.

 * callout(explore the Temple of Heaven on a planar surface):
 `explore()`
 
 1. Use the camera to detect a plain surface.

 2. Wait a few seconds until the Temple of Heaven appears before you.

 3. Now you can observe this historical legend from any angle you want, the Earth is by your side!

 Note: Since the model is pretty large and complicated, you may **wait for a moment while capturing a planar surface that are perpendicular to gravity**.

 If there is still no AR model for thirty seconds, you can try to find another plane.
