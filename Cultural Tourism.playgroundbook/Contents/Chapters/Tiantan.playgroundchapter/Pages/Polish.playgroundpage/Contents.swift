 *Please use this playgroundbook in landscape mode.*

 Aha! After you exploring the Temple of Heaven. There are several faded paintings inside.

 As a programmer, help them with your new learned machine learning knowledge!

 Good luck!

 * callout(use mlmodel to colorize the faded paintings):
 `polish()`

 * callout(use mlmodel to speculate the dynasty of the painting):
 `recognize()`

 * callout(change to another painting):
 `changePainting()`

 Special feature introduction: 
 
 Slide your finger on the painting to observe the part of the painting in the semicircular "bronze mirror".

 Note: Do not forget to remove the previous function while call a new function!

 *I have trained two mlmodels, the one use to colorize is pretty large. Since WWDC limits the size up to 25MB, I can only use the result after colorization, the mlmodel can be found on my GitHub: https://github.com/zjzsliyang/WWDC18Apply/.*
