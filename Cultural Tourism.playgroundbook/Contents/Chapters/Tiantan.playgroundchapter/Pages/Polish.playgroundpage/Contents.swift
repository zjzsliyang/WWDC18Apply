 Aha! You have found there! 
 
 The staff of the Temple of Heaven have some trouble.

 As a programmer, help them with your new learned machine learning knowledge!

Good luck!


 Note:

 *I trained two mlmodels, one to recognize the dytasty and the other is used to colorize. Since WWDC limits the size up to 25MB, I can not add colorize.mlmodel there and use the result after colorization, the mlmodel can be found on my GitHub.*
